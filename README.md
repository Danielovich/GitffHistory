# GitffHistory

Only on a experimental level.

I have had an issue with obtaining a broader view of git changes to a file over time.



I have not found a tool that can show me a good presentation of a linear history of a single files commits.

More than often I want to look at how a file has changed over time and at the same time have the full view of how that file looked at a given commit or change.

So this experiment has simply been to make a HTML output based on diff's from 4 different commits (I use an implementation of Eugene Meyer's O(ND) Difference Algorithm).

A video shows the output and you can find the HTML output in the repo here as well.
